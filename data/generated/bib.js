        "abstract": "Web users are confronted with the daunting challenges of creating, remembering, and using more and more strong passwords than ever before in order to protect their valuable assets on different websites. Password manager, particularly Browser-based Password Manager (BPM), is one of the most popular approaches designed to address these challenges by saving users' passwords and later automatically filling the login forms on behalf of users. Fortunately, all the five most popular Web browsers have provided password managers as a useful built-in feature. In this paper, we uncover the vulnerabilities of existing BPMs and analyze how they can be exploited by attackers to crack users' saved passwords. Moreover, we propose a novel Cloud-based Storage-Free BPM (CSF-BPM) design to achieve a high level of security with the desired confidentiality, integrity, and availability properties. We have implemented a CSF-BPM system into Firefox and evaluated its correctness, performance, and usability. Our evaluation results and analysis demonstrate that CSF-BPM can be efficiently and conveniently used. We believe CSF-BPM is a rational design that can also be integrated into other popular browsers to make the online experience of Web users more secure, convenient, and enjoyable.",

        "abstract": "While numerous flaws have been recognized in using passwords as a method of authentication, passwords still remain the de-facto authentication standard in use today. Though password managers can ameliorate password fatigue, the vast majority of password managers require the user to choose and maintain a strong master password while offering little to no recourse in the event that the master password is compromised. The wide-application of cloud-based password managers congregate passwords in an encrypted database, which becomes an attractive target for attackers and also represents a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose Amnesia, a bilateral generative password manager that requires both the knowledge of the master password and the possession of the user's smartphone to generate website passwords for the user. Our generative password manager is not vulnerable to the password database leakage, since it generates the requested password on demand using both the master password and the secret information on the smartphone. An attacker wishing to steal the user's website passwords has to compromise both the user's smartphone and the master password. Amnesia also has strong recovery capability when either the master password is compromised or the smartphone is lost/stolen. By using an Amnesia server, a user can have the access to the password manager on multiple computers without installing any software on those computers. We implemented an Amnesia system prototype using Android and Cherrypy web framework and evaluated it in terms of security, usability, and overhead. A user study of 31 testers shows that Amnesia increases password security while maintaining reasonable user convenience.",

        "abstract": "Password vaults are increasingly popular applications that store multiple passwords encrypted under a single master password that the user memorizes. A password vault can greatly reduce the burden on a user of remembering passwords, but introduces a single point of failure. An attacker that obtains a user's encrypted vault can mount offline brute-force attacks and, if successful, compromise all of the passwords in the vault. In this paper, we investigate the construction of encrypted vaults that resist such offline cracking attacks and force attackers instead to mount online attacks. Our contributions are as follows. We present an attack and supporting analysis showing that a previous design for cracking-resistant vaults -- the only one of which we are aware -- actually degrades security relative to conventional password-based approaches. We then introduce a new type of secure encoding scheme that we call a natural language encoder (NLE). An NLE permits the construction of vaults which, when decrypted with the wrong master password, produce plausible-looking decoy passwords. We show how to build NLEs using existing tools from natural language processing, such as n-gram models and probabilistic context-free grammars, and evaluate their ability to generate plausible decoys. Finally, we present, implement, and evaluate a full, NLE-based cracking-resistant vault system called NoCrack.",

        "abstract": "Honey encryption (HE) addresses the challenge of encrypting messages using keys that are vulnerable to guessing attacks, such as the passwords selected by ordinary users. HE creates a ciphertext that, when decrypted with an incorrect key or password, yields a valid-looking but bogus message. So, attackers can't tell when decryption has been successful. Counterintuitively, HE enables the encryption of a message using a weak password such that even a strong attacker--one with unlimited computing power--can't decrypt the message with certainty. You can use HE to encrypt the list of passwords in a password manager, credentials used in SSH (Secure Shell), and so on. HE fuses the creative use of honey objects and decoys in system security with the rigor and principled application imparted by cryptography.",

        "abstract": "Text password is an important authentication method for computer supported cooperative systems and is usually required to be memorable, strong, and non-reusable. Some password managers can help users manage site-specific passwords locally or on the cloud. However, existing solutions still have a single point of failure risk if the password management scheme is breached. To address the risks identified in current password managers, we proposed a password generation and management scheme called PassImg that can generate consistent passwords through hashing a master password with a user-specified salt image. In this scheme, a weak master password is also allowed while not affecting the security of the scheme. We\u2019ve also proposed a solution for offline parameters synchronization, which would decrease online attack vectors. The user-recognizable image as a parameter can be configured on different devices and synchronized through a QR code. PassImg can ensure password usability and security through an offline managing process without storing any data on the server.",

        "abstract": "While it is not recommended, Internet users tend to include personal information in their passwords for easy memorization. However, the use of personal information in passwords and its security implications have yet to be studied. In this paper, we dissect user passwords from several leaked data sets to investigate the extent to which a user's personal information resides in a password. Then, we introduce a new metric called coverage to quantify the correlation between passwords and personal information. Afterward, based on our analysis, we extend the probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) method to be semantics-rich and propose personal-PCFG to crack passwords by generating personalized guesses. Through offline and online attack scenarios, we demonstrate that personal-PCFG cracks passwords much faster than PCFG and makes online attacks much more likely to succeed. To defend against such semantics-aware attacks, we examine the use of simple distortion functions that are chosen by users to mitigate unwanted correlation between personal information and passwords.",

But it can also be used for authentication protocols as a replacement of hashing. In this paper, we propose an authentication protocol which will use Shamir's secret sharing method to authenticate with server. Hashing may not be able to hide data as effective in post quantum era. So in post quantum era, if any data server get exposed, users credentials can be also compromised as they were hidden by using hashing as an one way encryption. Our protocol will be able to solve this problem in a way that complete data exposure from server will not reveal the actual password provided by the user. So, even if the user uses same password for other online services/systems, these services and systems will not be effected.",

We have developed Versipass, a password manager that incorporates key elements of password managers and cued graphical passwords to avoid existing problems of password memorability and associating passwords with accounts. Instead of remembering passwords, Versipass remembers image cues for graphical passwords. These cues help users to better remember their passwords and to more easily link passwords with accounts. Versipass also facilitates safe password reuse by allowing users to use the same image cue for multiple accounts.",

        "abstract": "To ease the burden of repeated password authentication on multiple sites, modern Web browsers provide password managers, which offer to automatically complete password fields on Web pages, after the password has been stored once. Unfortunately, these managers operate by simply inserting the clear-text password into the document's DOM, where it is accessible by JavaScript. Thus, a successful Cross-site Scripting attack can be leveraged by the attacker to read and leak password data which has been provided by the password manager. In this paper, we assess this potential threat through a thorough survey of the current password manager generation and observable characteristics of password fields in popular Web sites. Furthermore, we propose an alternative password manager design, which robustly prevents the identified attacks, while maintaining compatibility with the established functionality of the existing approaches.",
