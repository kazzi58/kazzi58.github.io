    <h1>Privacy Policy for YOUR_APP_NAME</h1>
    <p class="meta">
        Effective date: <strong>[Insert date]</strong><br>
        Last updated: <strong>[Insert date]</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>YOUR_COMPANY_NAME</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) handles
        information when you use the <strong>YOUR_APP_NAME</strong> mobile application (the “App”).
        The App provides access to educational and training materials such as videos, images, and PDF documents
        for trainers and users, including those in remote areas with limited internet connectivity.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 No Account or Login</h3>
        <p>
            The App does <strong>not</strong> require users to create an account or log in. Anyone can download
            and use the App without providing personal details such as name, email address, phone number, or
            physical address.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 No User-Submitted Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
            The App does <strong>not</strong> provide features for users to submit personal information, such as
            profiles, messages, photos, or health information. Users simply access training and educational content
            (videos, images, public service announcements, and PDF documents) provided by YOUR_COMPANY_NAME.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 Automatically Collected Technical Data</h3>
        <p>
            The App may collect limited, non-personal technical information automatically through third-party
            services (primarily Google Firebase). This may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>App usage information (e.g., screens viewed, basic interaction events)</li>
            <li>Device information (e.g., device model, operating system version)</li>
            <li>Crash and error reports</li>
            <li>Anonymous performance and diagnostics data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This information is collected in an aggregated or anonymized form and is <strong>not used</strong> to
            personally identify you.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>
            The limited technical and usage information collected is used solely for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving the stability and performance of the App</li>
            <li>Identifying and fixing bugs and crashes</li>
            <li>Understanding general, anonymized usage patterns</li>
            <li>Enhancing the training and educational content we provide</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> use this information for targeted advertising, user profiling, or selling
            data to third parties.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Downloads and Offline Storage</h2>
        <p>
            The App allows users to download certain training resources (such as videos, images, and PDF materials)
            for offline access. This functionality is especially important in regions with limited or unstable
            internet connectivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            These downloaded files are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. The App does
            <strong>not</strong> upload any files or personal data from your device to our servers or to
            third-party servers.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App uses the following third-party services provided by Google Firebase:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> – to collect anonymous usage statistics and understand how the App is used.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> – to collect crash and error reports and improve app stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging</strong> (if enabled) – to send notifications such as updates or
                important information about the App.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore & Storage</strong> – to host and deliver
                app-provided content (such as training materials) to your device.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These services may collect device identifiers and technical data as described in their own privacy
            policies. For more information on how Google handles data, please review:
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Google’s Privacy Policy
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> share personally identifiable user data with any third parties.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect
            personal information from children. Since the App does not request or store personal data, the risk to
            children’s privacy is minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you believe that a child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us and we
            will take steps to remove such information if found.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable measures to protect the information processed in connection with the App. The content
            provided through the App is hosted on secure platforms, and communication with our services is typically
            encrypted using modern security protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the App does not collect or store sensitive personal data from users, the remaining privacy risk is
            primarily related to standard technical and usage information collected by third-party services.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
        <p>
            You can choose to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uninstall the App at any time to stop all data collection and usage.</li>
            <li>Use your device’s settings to restrict certain permissions or disable analytics where supported.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example, to reflect changes in the App, in our
            practices, or for legal or regulatory reasons. When we do, we will update the “Effective date” at the
            top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
        </p>
