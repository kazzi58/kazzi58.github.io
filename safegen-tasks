        <h1>The Magic of SafeGen: No More Stored Passwords!</h1>
        <p><strong>The beauty of SafeGen</strong>: This extension is unlike any other password manager. It never stores any passwords, so there's nothing to steal! Instead, every time you need a password, SafeGen generates it on-the-go. That means your password is created just when you need it and disappears into the void once youâ€™re done. Pretty neat, right?</p>

        <h2>How to Test SafeGen (and have some fun with it)</h2>
        <p>Letâ€™s put SafeGen to the test with a series of tasks designed to showcase its features. Follow the steps below and experience the magic firsthand!</p>

        <h2>Task 1: Signing Up with SafeGen</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, answer the security questions in SafeGen. These answers will be your key to generating passwords in the future, so donâ€™t forget them!</li>
            <li>Next, navigate to a website where you can sign up and log in later. We recommend <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a>, but feel free to use any site (just avoid sites where you already have an account, like Facebook).</li>
            <li>On the signup page, use SafeGen to generate a password. Donâ€™t worry, SafeGen has you covered with a strong, secure password!</li>
            <li>Complete the signup process and then head over to the login page of the same website.</li>
            <li>Use SafeGen to generate the password again and log in. Itâ€™s like magicâ€”SafeGen knows exactly what password you need without ever storing it!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Task 2: Login from a Different Browser (Yes, SafeGen Works Everywhere!)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Now, open a different browserâ€”letâ€™s say Edge. Donâ€™t worry, SafeGen works across browsers too!</li>
            <li>In Edge, enter your GitHub token into SafeGen. If you didnâ€™t save it, no problem! You can find the token in the settings menu of your SafeGen Chrome extension.</li>
            <li>Head over to the same website you signed up for in Task 1 (the one you signed up using Chrome).</li>
            <li>Try logging in with SafeGen again. Did you see the magic? SafeGen generated and autofilled the password, even though you're using a different browser!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Task 3: Recovering a Password (Because Forgetting Happens)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>SafeGen has an awesome recovery feature. You can recover your password even if you forget up to 2 answers out of 4 from the security questions. Handy, right?</li>
            <li>Navigate to the domain you want to recover your password for (make sure youâ€™ve generated a password for this site before).</li>
            <li>Go to SafeGenâ€™s settings and try the password recovery option.</li>
            <li>Answer any 2 security questions correctly (with the same answers you provided during setup), and voilaâ€”your password is magically recovered!</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="note">Note: You must have previously generated a password for the domain to use the recovery feature.</p>

        <p>Have fun exploring the SafeGen extension! It's not just about passwordsâ€”it's about security, convenience, and a little bit of magic. ðŸ˜Š</p>
